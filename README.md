## This is 
A (pretty much) first attempt to work with assembly to create a tiny game.
Inspired by [Lovebyte demoparty](https://lovebyte.party/), I thought I'd try to create something that fits in 256 bytes too.
This particular project will be a game in the form of a DOS .com game.

## Disclaimer

This repo exists because I want to save my work and be able to retrace my mistakes. I think version control is a must for most projects, however small.

I made this public, because it doesn't contain any big company secrets, passwords, or pieces of code that will give anybody a competitive advantage over anybody else in any real-life scenario that matters. It's not made public to service a a great example or tutorial. Feel free to read an learn, but no warranties.

If you want to learn about writing tiny games, you may want to check other sources instead, including some of the _Getting Started_ links at the bottom of that Lovebyte page ⬆️.

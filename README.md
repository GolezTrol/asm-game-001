# asm-game-001

A (pretty much) first attempt to work with assembly to create a tiny game. 
Inspired by [Lovebyte demoparty](https://lovebyte.party/), I thought I'd try to create something that fits in 256 bytes too.
This particular project will be a game in the form of a DOS .com game.

This repo exists because I think version control is a must for any IT project.
I made this public, because it doesn't contain any big company secrets, passwords, or pieces of code that will give anybody a competitive advantage over anybody else in any real-life scenario that matters.

If you want to learn about writing tiny games, you may want to check other sources, including some of the _Getting Started_ links at the bottom of that Lovebyte home page ⬆️.

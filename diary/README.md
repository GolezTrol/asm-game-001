# Diary

Keeping notes.

## 2022-02-07 - Setting up

After some initial experimentation this weekend, I set up this repository to restart the attempt.

- Created a working environment using VS Code.
- Build/Ctrl+Shift+B to build anim.asm into a com file.
- F5 (using F5 anything), to build the com file and run it in DOSbox.
- Started this diary.
